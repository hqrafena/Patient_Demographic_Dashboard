# Patient_Demographic_Dashboard

### Project Overview
This is a project I have created which focuses on analyzing and visualizing key demographic details of patients in a healthcare facility. 
It is an end-to-end project which involves from creating database in MySQL to deploying dashboard in Tableau Public.
The dashboard provides a snapshot of the patient population, offering valuable insights to hospital administrators and department managers for better resource allocation and service planning.

### Business Objectives
The project is to find insights on the following topics:
1. Age distribution of patients: The objective is to identify age group patterns and potential needs for specific healthcare services or resources geared toward the age groups.
2. Gender distribution of patients: The objective is to improve inclusivity in healthcare services.
3. Top patient diagnosis: The objective is to identify common diagnosis to allocate adequate resources for patients, optimize existing services and improve patient care planning.
4. Popular insurance types: The objective is to identify the common types of insurances held by the patients to help the hospital understand financial structures and tailor service providing accordingly.
5. Varying patient distribution by location: The objective is to find insights from the patient location distribution to help conduct outreach and community health initiatives.

### Key Business Metrics for Analysis
The following key metrics will help to achieve the busines objectives mentioned in the previous sections:
* Age Distribution
* Gender Distribution
* Top Diagnosis Categories
* Insurance Type Breakdown
* Location Distribution

### Project Summary
The Patient Demographics Dashboard offers an essential view into the demographic makeup of the hospitalâ€™s patient population, aiding administrators in decision-making and resource allocation.
By identifying age, gender, diagnosis, insurance, and location trends, this dashboard equips healthcare leaders with the insights necessary to optimize patient care and operational efficiency.
