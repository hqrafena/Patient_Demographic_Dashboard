# Patient_Demographic_Dashboard 

### Project Overview
This is an end-to-end project I have created which focuses on analyzing and visualizing key demographic details of patients in a healthcare facility. 
It is an end-to-end project which involves from creating database in MySQL to deploying dashboard in Tableau Public.
I have used self-generated values to do the analysis. 
The dashboard provides a snapshot of the patient population, offering valuable insights to hospital administrators and department managers for better resource allocation and service planning.

### Business Objectives
The project is to find insights on the following topics:
1. Age distribution of patients: The objective is to identify age group patterns and potential needs for specific healthcare services or resources geared toward the age groups.
2. Gender distribution of patients: The objective is to improve inclusivity in healthcare services.
3. Top patient diagnosis: The objective is to identify common diagnosis to allocate adequate resources for patients, optimize existing services and improve patient care planning.
4. Popular insurance types: The objective is to identify the common types of insurances held by the patients to help the hospital understand financial structures and tailor service providing accordingly.
5. Varying patient distribution by location: The objective is to find insights from the patient location distribution to help conduct outreach and community health initiatives.

### Key Business Metrics for Analysis
The following key metrics will help to achieve the busines objectives mentioned in the previous sections:
* Age Distribution
* Gender Distribution
* Top Diagnosis Categories
* Insurance Type Breakdown
* Location Distribution

### Insights & Recommendations
The following includes observations from the individual visualizations and dashboards:
- Gender percentage among “Male” and “Female” patients are same. There is a significantly low number of patients who identified themselves as "Other" (1).
    <p>
    Recommendation: Enhancing inclusivity initiatives by developing targeted outreach, support services and improving inclusivity practices.
    </p>
    
- There may be gender gap in the payment method of patient care services, since female patients are substantially more likely to "Self-Pay" (17%) than male patients (2%).
    <p>
    Recommendation: Introducing flexible payment plans for the female patients to alleviate financial barriers and improve patient satisfaction.
    </p>
- The most popular insurance type held by patients is Medicare(12), followed by Medicaid (10), Aetna (10) , Blue Cross (10).
- The least popular insurances held by patient are Cigna (8), Humana (8), Charity (8).
    <p>
    Recommendation: Taking the initiative to host outreach programs for less popular insurance providers to attract broader patient demographic which can
    lead to acquiring new patients for the hospital
    </p>
- Early 30’s (33) and late 40’s (48) age group patient dominate the age demographics among the patients.
    <p>
    Recommendation: Allocating resources to tailor healthcare services that meet the unique needs of this major patient age-group.
    </p>
- Geographically, most number of patients come from CA(15), followed by TX (13) and the least number of patients come from KS (1) , MN (1) and LA (1).
    <p>
    Recommendation: Coming up with marketing campaign in the low patient count states. On the other hand, expanding facilities in the high patient representative states.
    </p>
    
### Project Summary
The Patient Demographics Dashboard offers an essential view into the demographic makeup of the hospital’s patient population, aiding administrators in decision-making and resource allocation.
By identifying age, gender, diagnosis, insurance, and location trends, this dashboard equips healthcare leaders with the insights necessary to optimize patient care and operational efficiency.

### Limitations
Having a larger dataset would have been useful to get a better grasp of the patient demographic of the hospital system. This also includes having access to many more tables (execluding sensitive information of the patients) from the original database and get more information of the patients to do more analysis on the topic.
